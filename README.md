# Interview Preparation Repository
Welcome to my interview preparation repository! The main goal of this repository is to improve my skills in algorithms and data structures. I achieve this by working through a curated set of problems sourced from Codeforces, organized in an Excel file.

## Contents
Excel File: Contains a comprehensive list of problems covering various topics in algorithms and data structures such as stack, heap, queues, graphs, and more.
Problem Files: Each problem listed in the Excel file corresponds to a separate file in this repository. These files contain the problem statements and my solutions.

## Approach
I aim to solve as many problems as possible, ensuring to cover a wide range of topics. By doing so, I hope to strengthen my understanding and proficiency in algorithms and data structures, thereby better preparing myself for technical interviews.

Feel free to explore the problem files and solutions. Your feedback and suggestions are always appreciated!
